**Subject:** Journal of Paleontological Techniques has made a decision concerning your manuscript: What do we mean by the directions “cranial” and “caudal” on a vertebra?

Dear Mike (and Matt),

Thank you for your resubmission. Both reviewers agree that it is much improved. The email you recieve probably has a big header 'Revise and resubmit,' but please know this is only for some minor changes and it will not need to go out to review once again. If you can address the reviewers concerns, and my comment at the end of this message, I see no reason the manuscript cannot be accepted without further review.

You will hopefully find the comments and annotated PDFs attached or available through the scholastica system - please let me know if they're not available to you.

Both reviewers just have minor comments, and both waived annonymity. The initial reviewers were kind enough to offer thei expertise again for this round of review, and both were complimentary of your changes in light of their suggestions.

Reviewer 1 (Marek) suggests combining figures where you can. Personally, I am less worried about this, but there is room for combining - figure 11 and 12 immediately jump out as possible to go together, especially as there is only 1 line of text between where you feel the images should go. Others could probably be combined for clarity too, though I note Reviewer 2 strongly disagrees that figures can be condensed, so I leave this to your judgement in light of their comments. Reviewer 1 also provides some additional references that may be pertinent; these are suggestions for you to take a look at and decide if they may offer other avenues of utility to your work.

Reviewer 2 (Tschopp) has minor comments in the attached PDF, and also mentioned that you had not quite addressed one of their earlier concerns. This was posted in comments to editor, but I repeat here so as to not misrepresent Tschopp's comment:

> --“Measurement of the neural canal cross-section cannot be “corrected using sectioned vertebrae” in general —the point of the present paper is how we can get consistent results using the vertebrae we have, in the condition they are in. “Just section the vertebra” is not always a practical option. We have reworded the relevant section to make it clearer.”
>
> --This is of course correct, but maybe this was not really the point in my initial comment (I admit my comment didn’t transmit my concerns very well). The point is that I think it is general use that cross-sections of something should be measured perpendicular to their long axis, so in the case of measuring neural canal cross-section, this wouldn’t depend on the actual orientation of the vertebra itself, but simply on the long axis of the neural canal. In the given images used to strengthen the authors’ point (Fig. 2), it is pretty obvious in cranial/caudal views if the canal is tilted or not, so that taking a measurement of the cross-section in such view is simply not scientifically sound, regardless of how one defined the orientation of the entire vertebra.
>
> --Not to understand me wrong, I agree on Definition 3 being the most logical, but I just don’t think this argumentation is a strong case against Definition 1, because I don’t think anybody would (or at least should!) actually run into the issue of orienting the entire vertebra when measuring neural canal cross-sections – people should orient the neural canal instead in these cases.

I agree with Reviewer 2 here - I find it highly unlikely someone would look at your figure 2B, and try to measure cross sectional area from the slanted neural canal as it appears in the image. Regardless of how the vertebra were oriented, cross section of the neural canal would be perpendicular to the neural canal, not automatically vertical relative to the vertebra. It's still a relatively minor point, but perhaps you could address this at the end of page 2/start of page 3, either by deleting text, or expanding on it.

My only other substantive comment as handling editor is that I really do think your "open peer review" section belongs under acknowledgements. This section has no bearing on the science of your paper, and readers looking for information about vertebral orientation do not benefit from this. I do agree with you that open peer review is a good thing, and that it is correct to acknowledge it to the degree you do. But it is just that - an acknowledgement of open peer review, and the source of inspiration for this paper. I have no problem with a headed section like this appearing under acknowledgements, i.e. copy-pasting the Open peer review section with sub-heading to the end of the acknowledgements, but it is inappropriate to keep it in the main text. I realise this aspect is important to you, so I do not make this reccomendation lightly.

Can I also suggest you use Gimp/Photoshop/your preferred image editor to crop extraneous background from figures 11 and 12 to aid clarity for readers, and provide consistency with the rest of your figures?

If you've any questions, just drop me an email.

Regards,

Dr Peter Falkingham
