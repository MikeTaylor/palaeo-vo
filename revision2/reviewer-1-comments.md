# Open response questions

## Comments concerning methodology

Comments for the methodology largely revolve around the figures. The total figure count needs be halved, as many figures could be merged. There are also some examples on unintuitive figure labelling (see comments in text).

There could be more discussion surrounding the applicability of the toothpick method to actual fossils (see comment on p. 9).

## Comments concerning results and conclusions

Some more references for the discussion of definition 3 (p.10) would be greatly appreciated. Additional references in this section would be greatly bolstered with any relevant literature outside of sauropods.

## General comments to authors

Overall this submission is much improved over the last - the new structure works well and the overall tone and language of the manuscript is excellent. The main issues to address are the figures (they need to be cut down/merged) and the overall scope/implications of the work. I can see this having broader implications outside of illustrations/sauropod taxonomy - e.g. anatomy, functional morphology and morphometrics. Including such aspects in the current manuscript is optional, but I would advise the authors to take a look at some recent vertebral morphometrics papers (outlined below) to see for themselves if they feel they’re work is applicable to this field.
