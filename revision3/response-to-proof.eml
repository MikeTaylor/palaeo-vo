Thanks, Femke. Yes, Word format is better when many corrections are needed,
but hopefully we're past that point! And other corrections pertain to the
formatting itself, so it's important to see it more or less as it will
appear. My and Matt's thoughts on the proof PDF are as follows:

* The last paragraph of the abstract (beginning "We advocate explicitly
...") are part of the abstract and should be indented to the same level as
the first paragraph.
* Personal preference here rather than a correction *per se*, but in the
"How to cite this paper", I would prefer to see full first names instead of
initials.
* The URL to the journal — www.jpaleontologicaltechniques.org — is for the
old site, not the new.
* In response to question FH1, we very much want to keep Figure 2 as a
single illustration, as its purpose is showing the contrast between the two
orientations.
* "sighting directly along the neural canal will maximize the apparent
cross-sectional area of the neural canal" -- change to "... will maximize
its apparent cross-sectional area".
* In the caption for figure 2, add "(below)" after both "Definition 2" and
"Definition 3".
* In the caption for figure 3, change "Taylor and Wedel 2013: figure 2,
reversed" to "... reversed and modified".
* The institutional abbreviation "MNHAH — Museum of Nature and Human
Activities, Hyogo, Japan" does not appear to be used, and can be removed.
* "METHODS ... Four definitions of "horizontal" ... 1. Long axis of centrum
is horizontal". We are concerned that there is not much differentiation
between these three levels of heading, and in particular that the second
and third-level headings look identical. This obscures the structure of the
argument.
* "We have conceived four candidate definitions": replace "conceived" with
"formulated".
* In the caption for figure 6: "Orientation Definitions 2–4 illustrated for
the two vertebrae": delete "the".
* Also in the caption for figure 6 "(A, C). In “articular surfaces
vertical” orientation (Definition 2)": replace "C" with "D".
* "Strongly opisthocoelous vertebrae such as giraffe cervicals ...". Append
"(Figure 6D)".
* "For some vertebrae, there is a clear ridge projecting outward from the
concave articular extremity". Dumb mistake: "concave" should of course read
"convex"!
* "The third definition fixed the orientation of the neural canal": for
"fixed", substitute "fixes".
* "A second difficulty, as again shown by the *Haplocanthosaurus* caudal of
Figure 6A–C, the individual
margins of the neural canal may not be straight.". Insert "is that"  before
"the individual".
* "Note that this definition does not require two vertebrae": there is no
vertical whitespace before this paragraph to separate it from the numbered
list just before.
* "Practical approaches to determining horizontal orientation": again, this
heading is not visually distinguished from the lower-level headings that
precede and follow it.
* "... the most frequently used orientation when illustrating
craniocaudally short vertebra": pluralize the last word to "vertebrae".
* In caption to figure 13: "Two consecutive instances of hemisected 9th
cervical vertebra". Insert "the" before "hemisected".
* Orientation by neural canal is also used in illustration such as":
pluralize "illustration" to "illustrations".
* "It can be used when only a relatively small part of the vertebra to be
preserved": replace "to be" with "is".
* In response to question FH2, Owen's (1854) book has 329 pages.
* In response to question FH3, yes, "Anonymous" is correct among the list
of authors here. The reference is to a peer-review history and the authors
are the handling editor and the peer-reviewers, one of whom was anonymous.

 Otherwise this all looks good. We'll look forward to seeing the typeset
version with these errors fixed!

-- Mike.
