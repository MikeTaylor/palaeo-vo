This is an in-progress paper outlining rigorous definitions of vertebral orientation.

See also: /Users/mike/git/mike/dino/conferences/vpc-2018/talk/images on Mike's laptop. (I will move all relevant material into here eventually.)

See https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0091653  
The Materials & Methods section in this paper defines a coordinate system that is based on the centers of the cranial and caudal articular surfaces of the centrum. Worth citing first because it demonstrates that some studies require people to define how they are orienting the vertebrae, and second because their preferred solution is different from ours but makes sense in the context of their study.
