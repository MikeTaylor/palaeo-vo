## Introduction

In late 2017, one of us submitted a paper (Taylor 2018b) redescribing the sauropod dinosaur _Xenoposeidon_ and assigning it to the group Rebbachisauridae, based on the holotype and only specimen NHMUK PV R2095. Among the five diagnostic characters given for _Xenoposeidon_ was #2, “Neural arch slopes anteriorly 30°–35° relative to the vertical” (Taylor 2018b:5). In a helpful and detailed peer review, Phil Mannion (2018a) commented:

> The strong anterior slant of the neural arch appears to be dependent on how you've chosen to orientate the vertebra, but there doesn't appear to be any need to orientate it in this way.

I (Taylor) carelessly failed to directly address this criticism in my response letter, although I did add a brief discussion of the orientation. Consequently Mannion raised the matter again in the second round of review (Mannion 2018b):

> I'm still unconvinced by the proposed anterior slant of the vertebra and don't think that there's any evidence for orientating it in this way. I went into the NHM to re-look at this. No aspect of the posterior articular surface of the centrum leads me to orient the vertebra in the same way of shown in your figures. In addition, as currently orientated, the floor of the neural canal is strongly tilted - it seems more conservative to assume that this is horizontal. Similarly, by following that orientation, this would then make the long-axis of the lateral pneumatic opening closer to horizontal. By orientating the vertebra this way, the anterior margin is sub-vertical, with a very gentle anterior deflection (i.e. fairly normal for a sauropod), and the M-lamina is much closer in orientation to that of _Rebbachisaurus_.

I responded (Taylor 2018a):

> Phil remains convinced that the proper orientation of the vertebra gives is a lesser forward slope that as described in the manuscript. Having once more revisited my photos and 3D models, I remain convinced that the present orientation is essentially correct. It could be out by five degrees or so, so I have changed “35 degrees” to “30-35 degrees” throughout.

Mannion was gracious enough to accept this, and the paper proceeded to publication with the relevant section (Taylor 2018b:5) essentially unchanged. But the question he had raised continued to occupy me: what exactly _is_ the “correct” orientation of the vertebra, relative to which we can measure the angle of the sloping neural arch? And what do we even mean by “correct”? Figure A shows the difference between the slope as published (part A), and as interpreted by Mannion (part B).

The neural arch slopes relative to the vertical. Vertical is defined as being orthogonal to the horizontal. That in turn is defined by the cranial-caudal (= anterior-posterior) axis. But what do those directions mean? How can we define them for a given vertebra?

In the present paper, we aim to answer that question. We will propose and discuss four candidate criteria, recommend the one we consider most practical and informative, and determine the slope of _Xenoposeidon_'s neural arch more precisely.

Note that the present question is nothing to do with life posture, which is a much more difficult problem, subject to many more degrees of uncertainty. Animals do not hold their vertebral columns any anything close to true horizontal — not even though that we characterise as having horizontal posture — and we do not want to tie the meaning of our very nomenclature to something so variable and unpredictable. Otherwise we would have to define “horizontal” for the mid-cervical vertebrae of parrots as upside-down (Figure B).

Note the very strong 'S'-curve of the neck, such that the most caudal cervical vertebrae are inclined downwards, then more cranial vertebrae are, progressively, inclined upwards, near vertical, sloping _backwards_, then vertical again, and finally sloping upwards to the skull.

Instead, we seek abstract notions of "horizontal", "cranial" and "caudal" that apply irrespective of the specific posture adopted by an animal — something that is especially important for the study of extinct animals for which habitual posture cannot be known with certainty and remains controversial (e.g. sauropod neck posture: Steven and Parrish 1999 vs. Taylor et al. 2009). Our goal is to have an objective standard by which to assess properties such as the slope of a neural arch.

### Anatomical nomenclature

As dinosaur palaeontologists, we generally use and prefer the Owenian system of anatomical directions, with anterior and posterior indicating the forward and backward directions accordingly (Owen 1854) — hence the use of these terms in the _Xenoposeidon_ paper, its reviews, and the associated discussion. However, for the present paper, we seek directional definitions that are unambiguous for all vertebrates: not only those like dinosaurs, dogs and fish, which hold their vertebral columns essentially horizontal; but also those like humans, penguins and meerkats, which hold their vertebral columns essentially vertical. For this reason, avoiding ambiguity in humans, where “anterior” means ventral (towards the belly) rather than cranial (towards the head), we will use terms cranial and caudal, and derived terms such as craniodorsal.

## Discussion

### Relevance to other work

XXX

### Open peer review

In publishing the _Xenoposeidon_ revision (Taylor 2018b) in the journal _PeerJ-, I (Taylor) was pleased to take advantage of the journal's policy of allowing submitted drafts, peer-reviews, response letters and handling editors' comments to be published alongside the final paper. It is because these materials are published (### Young et al. 2018) that the sequence of discussion is preserved, and Mannion's helpful and gracious comments are available to be read — not only as the extracts in the present paper, but in their full context.

We endorse the publication of peer reviews, and both take this option whenever it is offered. Aside from their value as part of the scholarly record, published peer-reviews are visible evidence of the reviewers’ broader contribution to science, and can be taken into account in evaluating researchers for jobs, promotions, tenure and grants. Sets of reviews, accompanied by the corresponding versions of the manuscript, can be an important pedagogical tool for teaching students in practical terms how peer-review works: for example, Andy Farke (Raymond M. Alf Museum) writes “I use those published reviews when we are talking about the process of scientific publication. I have the students read the reviews and read the responses, and then talk about how the paper changed as a result” (pers. comm. 2018). Crucially, reviews can play an important role in the origination of new research questions, and should be acknowledged: the present work on defining vertebral orientation arises directly from Phil Mannion's peer-review comments (Mannion 2018a, 2018b).

### Open composition

This work first began to take shape as a series of blog-posts (Taylor 2018c, Taylor 2018d, Wedel 2018a, Wedel 2018b, Wedel 2018c) which were drawn together in a talk (Taylor and Wedel 2018) presented by Taylor as part of the 1st Palaeontological Virtual Congress (http://palaeovc.uv.es/) and announced online (Wedel 2018d). This manuscript was developed in the open, in a public GitHub repository (https://github.com/MikeTaylor/palaeo-vo; see Taylor 2018e). We commend this approach as valuable for soliciting informal feedback early in the process, and in making the research itself available quickly.
