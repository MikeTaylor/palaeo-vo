# Reviewer comments on restructuring


## Marek

The current manuscript [...] would benefit immensely from a restructure to fit a more traditional journal publication format (Introduction, Material and Methods, Results, Discussion).

The central motivation for the project appears to be hinged on reviewer comments from a previous publication [...] This focus reduces the impact of the findings as the introduction doesn’t introduce the reader to wider problems that this publication may solve (e.g. biomechanical measurements that are mentioned much later in the manuscript).

This should entail the replacement of much of the commentary on the review process of Taylor 2018b with wider implications for the field (biomechanical measurements, taxonomic character states etc.), both in the introduction and in the discussion.

Anatomical Nomenclature, institutional abbreviations and the methods used to delineate horizontal (e.g. 3D printed Xenoposeidon models, the rolled up paper method, as well as a brief description of the 4 definitions of horizontal) should be compiled to form a ‘Materials and Method section’. The more comparative aspects of the 4 definitions should be moved to a ‘Results’ section and the remainder of the manuscript from ‘Comparison of definitions’ onwards should be combined to form a ‘Discussion’ section.

References to the review process of Taylor 2018b should be drastically reduced. Whilst it is a good framing device for outlining the problem, it should be restricted to one or two sentences. The rest of the introduction should introduce the wider implications of vertebral orientation in palaeontology and other closely related fields (taxonomy, functional morphology, biomechanics) and discuss the issue in non-sauropod taxa.


## Tschopp

I would propose a structure for the paper with an introduction as outlined above, a methods section followed by the various definitions, comparisons, and recommendations, the case study of Xenoposeidon (which should include what is now in the introduction), and finally the discussion. The paper would profit a lot with a fairly detailed methods section, including terminology of the vertebra, its possible orientation/directional terms, and structures that help orientating, explanation of how vertebrae can be oriented physically and/or digitally (which is now spread out over the descriptions of the methods 1-4), how to draw lines along curved articular surfaces (written within method 3 I think), how to articulate copies of vertebrae in 2D and 3D graphics programs (and thereby how the figures in the paper were produced), and the “paper roll” method to check orientation of the neural canal.

The introduction should outline a biological or methodological problem, and the context of the study, not the personal history of how the study came to be.
