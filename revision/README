As noted in Peter Falkingham's decision email of 3 Jan 2020, reviews are at:
https://app.scholasticahq.com/manuscripts/958944-what-do-we-mean-by-the-directions-cranial-and-caudal-on-a-vertebra/decisions/511979
Those reviews are also contained in these files:

reviewer1_comments.docx -- Ryan D. Marek's review
reviewer2_comments.docx -- Emanuel Tschopp's review

But this directory also contains two other important files. Writing in
November 2021, I no longer know where I got these review files from:
they are not attached to the email from Falkingham, nor apparently
linked from the Scholastica review page:

27649-anonymized-attachment-for-review-181586.docx
	Ryan D. Marek's review again, but this time also including
	detailed comments absent from the Scholastica version.

ms1_rev.doc
	Emanuel Tschopp's annotated manuscript.

Finally, I have added one more file, copied from the email:,
"editorial-comments.txt", which is what it says.

In response, I first created "response-to-reviews.docx", which
summarises what changes I do and do not intend to make. Those still
waiting to be done are marked with "XXX".

The actual revised manuscript is "vo-manuscript--MASTER--v2.docx".
