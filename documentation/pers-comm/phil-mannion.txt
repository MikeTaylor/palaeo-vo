vertebral orientation. I and Matt are now working on a paper<br>
discussing this more depth, and I would like to quote from your<br>

---------------- begin quote ----------------<br>
In late 2017, one of us submitted a paper (Taylor 2018b) redescribing<br>
the sauropod dinosaur Xenoposeidon and assigning it to the group<br>
Rebbachisauridae, based on the holotype and only specimen NHMUK PV<br>
R2095. Among the five diagnostic characters given for Xenoposeidon was<br>
#2, =E2=80=9CNeural arch slopes anteriorly 30=C2=B0=E2=80=9335=C2=B0 relati=
ve to the vertical=E2=80=9D<br>
(Taylor 2018b:5). In a helpful and detailed peer review, Phil Mannion<br>
(XXX Mannion 2018a) commented:<br>
<br>
&gt; The strong anterior slant of the neural arch appears to be dependent o=
n how you&#39;ve chosen to orientate the vertebra, but there doesn&#39;t ap=
pear to be any need to orientate it in this way.<br>
<br>
I (Taylor) carelessly failed to directly address this criticism in my<br>
response letter, although I did add a brief discussion of the<br>
orientation. Consequently Mannion raised the matter again in the<br>
second round of review (XXX Mannion 2018b):<br>
<br>
&gt; I still don&#39;t agree with this, and I don&#39;t see any clear evide=
nce for orientating it this way. I went into the NHM to re-look at this. No=
 aspect of the posterior articular surface of the centrum leads me to orien=
t the vertebra in the same way of shown in your figures. In addition, as cu=
rrently orientated, the floor of the neural canal is strongly tilted - it s=
eems more conservative to assume that this is horizontal. Similarly, by fol=
lowing that orientation, this would then make the long-axis of the lateral =
pneumatic opening closer to horizontal.<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; By orientating the vertebra this way, the anterior margin is sub-verti=
cal, with a very gentle anterior deflection, and the M-lamina is much close=
r in orientation to that of Rebbachisaurus.<br>
<br>
I responded (Taylor 2018a):<br>
<br>
&gt; Phil remains convinced that the proper orientation of the vertebra giv=
es is a lesser forward slope that as described in the manuscript. Having on=
ce more revisited my photos and 3D models, I remain convinced that the pres=
ent orientation is essentially correct. It could be out by five degrees or =
so, so I have changed =E2=80=9C35 degrees=E2=80=9D to =E2=80=9C30-35 degree=
s=E2=80=9D throughout.<br>
<br>
Mannion was gracious enough to accept this, and the paper proceeded to<br>
publication with the relevant section (Taylor 2018b:5) essentially<br>
unchanged. But the question he had raised continued to occupy me: what<br>
exactly is the =E2=80=9Ccorrect=E2=80=9D orientation of the vertebra, relat=
ive to<br>
which we can measure the angle of the sloping neural arch? And what do<br>
we even mean by =E2=80=9Ccorrect=E2=80=9D?<br>
